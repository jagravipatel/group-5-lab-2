                <li id = "BW"><b>Blue Whale</b></li>
                <p>The Blue Whale is the largest animal to ever live, in the entire history of Earth. Reaching lengths of at least 110 feet (33 meters) and weights of 209 tons (190 tonnes), these animals are only slightly smaller than the United States Space Shuttle. Their incredible size is only possible because of their aquatic lifestyles and the buoyancy provided by seawater. On land, an animal as lare as the Blue Whale would almost certainaly be crushed under its own weight.
