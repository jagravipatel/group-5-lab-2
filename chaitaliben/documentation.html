				<h2> Chapter 3: Modular origami crafts work</h2>
		<p>Modular origami or unit origami is a paperfolding technique which uses two or more sheets of paper to create a larger and more complex structure than would be possible using single-piece origami techniques.
		</p>
		<ol>
			<b><li>
				Fish
			</li></b>
			<p>

			<b><li>
				Swan
			</li></b>
			<p>Each individual sheet of paper is folded into a module, or unit, and then modules are assembled into an integrated flat shape or three-dimensional structure by inserting flaps into pockets created by the folding process. These insertions create tension or friction that holds the model together.</p>

			<b><li> Cubical ball </li></b> 
			<p>The six modules required for this design were developed from the traditional Japanese paperfold commonly known as the menko. Each module forms one face of the finished cube.</p>
